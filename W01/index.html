<!--Instructions: 
Coding Steps:
*Step 1: Create a website using only HTML. The website can be anything you like (within school guidelines) 
if it meets the following criteria:
*Step 2: Create a homepage named index.html
    *At least 3 pages with links to navigate between all pages present on each page.
    *2 different size headers, a list, 3 images, a table, and a form.
Video Steps: 
*Step 1: Create a video, up to five minutes max, showing and explaining how your project works with an emphasis on the portions you contributed.
    *This video should be done using screen share and voice over.
    *This can easily be done using Zoom, although you don't have to use Zoom, it's just what we recommend.
        *You can create a new meeting, start screen sharing, and start recording.
        *This will create a video recording on your computer.
*Step 2: This should then be uploaded to a publicly accessible site, such as YouTube.
        *Ensure the link you share is PUBLIC or UNLISTED!
        *If it is not accessible by your grader, your project will be graded based on what they can access.
